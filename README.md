## AlzheimersCaregiver
Android app which will help patients with Alzheimer and dementia. App has a list of features that aligns to what patients require on a day to day basis.  Major problem with Alzheimer patients would be to help them with daily chores. Alzheimer care targets all such problem and helps to get all features under one app. List of features is explained in the later part of this document. 
A smart medicine box has also been introduced which is connected to an android application leveraging IOT and Cloud framework. Embedded sensor within the smart medicine box detects when a patient misses medication to send real time notifications to both the patient and the care giver when patients miss their scheduled medication. This enables care-givers to intervene as needed to ensure patients take their medications.
